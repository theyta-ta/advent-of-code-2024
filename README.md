my first aoc :D

solutions are done in [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/), 
and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) if i need to do it in something thats not an array language,
or if im helping someone do their own rust solution, and write a solution on my machine while helping them.

my solutions are not timed, as i am new to array programming and will probably write bad and slow solutions for the problems.
