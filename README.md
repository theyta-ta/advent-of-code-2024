my first aoc :D

solutions were done in [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/), 
and now in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 
because quite frankly array programming scared me and i spook easily.

because i missed 8 whole days of problems, right now i am just banging out solutions.
i will format them nicer and optimize them later, if i have the time and energy.
